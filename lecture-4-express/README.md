Express.js -- Pokedex
What are you building?
In today's class we are going to use express to build a Pokedex. The goal is to demonstrate routing, path parameters, query parameters, C-R-U-D operations.

GET --- Querying
PUT, POST, DELETE --- Mutating
No persistence (since we don't have a database)
GraphQL --- only uses post (querying AND mutating)
